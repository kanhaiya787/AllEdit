This function will be passed a string that is the origin (or undefined if the request has no origin), and a callback with the signature callback(error, origin).\n\nThe origin argument to the callback can be any value allowed for the origin option of the middleware, except a function. See the confugration options section for more information on all the possible value types.\n\nThis function is designed to allow the dynamic loading of allowed origin(s) from a backing datasource, like a database."}]
